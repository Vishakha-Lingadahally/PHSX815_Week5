# PHSX815_Week5: Sampling

Running the code:
Run the code by typing "/Path/Sampling.py" on the command line for computation of the sampling and obtaining the plots.

Description:
The target function that I have defined is 1.3-x^3 in the interval [0,1]. I've performed sampling in the interval and plotted the sampling distribution in the form of a histogram.
